## Free things

[Odin + Raylib + Hot Reload template](https://github.com/karl-zylinski/odin-raylib-hot-reload-game-template) >>> *This template was spawned out of working on [Train game](https://github.com/karl-zylinski-subscribers/trains) and trying to create a more structured foundation that [CAT & ONION](https://github.com/karl-zylinski-subscribers/cat-and-onion) had. It was used as the basis for [Top-down adventure game](https://github.com/karl-zylinski-subscribers/adventure)*
